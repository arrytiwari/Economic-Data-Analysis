# Economic-Data-Analysis-data-scraping-cleaning-and-exploration-
This project focuses on analyzing unemployment rate and participation rate data for each state using the FRED API.


## Project Description

In this project, we leverage the FRED API to scrape, clean, and explore unemployment rate and participation rate data for each state in the United States. The project involves the following steps:

- Data scraping: We use the `fredapi` library to access the FRED API and retrieve the required data series related to unemployment rate and participation rate.

- Data cleaning: We perform necessary data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing the data format to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

- Data exploration: We conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the unemployment rate and participation rate trends across different states. This includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and trend analysis.

## Data Source

The data for this project is obtained from the FRED API. The FRED API provides access to a wide range of economic data series published by various sources. More information about the FRED API and the available data can be found at [FRED API Documentation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/).
